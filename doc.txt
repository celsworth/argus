CODING CONVENTIONS I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER AND STICK TO ;)
* @synthesize is being phased out, stop using it and remove old ones
  * use _instancevar = foo in init* only
  * use self.instancevar everywhere else
    * EXCEPT IN SETTERS, it causes infinite loops :/
* replace [x objectAtIndex:] with x[] (and objectForKey?), and all the setters eventually
* dot notation or [] notation is personal preference really
  * I like dots for an instance var or property, [] for selectors, but this isn't a hard and fast rule




TODO:
* connection timeout in preferences?

* add Reachability class and don't bother trying to do anything when offline?
  * finish isWWAN()


* When loading new tables which need data, ie Whats On -> Programme List
  the right thing to do seems to be to replace disclosure indicators with a spinner
  then push the view when the data is ready.. implement this everywhere?


* schedule edit; "between times" was unset, added some times, didn't say "schedule not saved"
  work out why and fix

* getSchedules invokes 3 HTTP requests all the time, bit wasteful. could we just do one if scheduleType changed?

* iPhone Search Results: tablecell height could be varied depending if it's upcoming recording or not


OUTSTANDING BUGS/ISSUES:
* SetUpcomingProgram* methods sometimes return 500 "An unknown database error occurred" randomly.
  Retrying the request works fine though, could be internal Argus bug.
* Channel logos occasionally disappear. Tracked this down to incorrect contents being written to
  on-disk image files, but no idea why..
* UpcomingProgrammeEdit does O(n) lookup on UpcomingProgrammes to get its object
  this isn't critical (it's low-frequency code) but would be inefficient with big lists
  we can improve this to O(1) by restoring UpcomingProgrammesKeyedByUpcomingProgramId
* call cancelLocalNotification after a few minutes so they don't pile up?
* check that failed connections reduce the networkActivity count properly



* REPRODUCIBLE CRASH
  view schedules page so it loads them in (dunno if necessary)
  view upcoming programmes and change schedule type
  view schedules again, scroll down to get more rows - crash
  because the [entries count] isn't updated when the schedule type changes in another screen
  * fixes?
    1) each screen has it's own channeltype and scheduletype
	   .. this would be significantly better than using the ChannelGroup's channeltype
	2) AppDelegate has a ChannelType and ScheduleType which everything uses
	   .. when either is changed it sends notification



LIMITATIONS IN EDIT SCHEDULE TO FIX:
* advanced boolean queries on ProgramInfo/Description aren't handled properly
  Even the MMC doesn't handle them properly so probably nobody will ever notice
  Argus sends multiple ProgramInfoContains args for ANDed queries, and we only handle one
  If you prefix the query with NOT it won't even handle an OR
* If DaysOfWeek and OnDate are set, OnDate actually changes to "from date" and is
  bundled with DaysOfWeek. We don't handle this yet, and we should


MUNDANE STUFF THAT COULD BE IMPROVED (not important)
* Previously Recorded History cell could be a class
* Improve iOS-feel, make better use of iOS conventions in UI
  * Delete Schedule could be done in Schedules table (Edit -> Delete)
* Start converting notifications to block-based where appropriate
  * Generally selectors that are only ever called from one notification



PUBLIC ROADMAP:
* finish schedules (Directed By, Actors, Current Recordings)
* colour coded EPG according to programme categories
* light and dark switchable colour schemes
* improve search to use complete schedule rule engine
* show notifications when an upcoming programme alert is starting
* localisation


* Browse/delete recordings
* make better use of iPad screen space (tedious)
  * probably we don't need to split up edit schedule so much, but this means writing
    a whole new view controller to handle every element on one page?
	* improve MVC here, check that view controllers aren't doing too much?
* In-App Prefs?
* Debug/Internal Settings
  * log of connections and responses
  * forget credentials
  * refetch schedules/upcoming/channels etc
* "Submit anonymous crash reports" preference closer to release
* when rotating on dynamic row height screens (Programme List so far), it'd be nice to re-scroll
  the visible rows to what they were before. Investigate how..
* copy % shown progress view from what's on to ProgrammeList?
* don't pass Argus* objects around so much, especially ones that can change
  * eg ArgusUpcomingProgramme will be released and remade when the list is updated
  * look for other instances where I do this and fix to pass an Id that won't change instead
    * schedule edit - this is worked around because the Schedule object in ScheduleViewController
	  gets a new originalData when SaveSchedule comes back, but should still pass an Id in really
	  * or not, when creating a new schedule the Id is 00-00-00 so this will fail to find it in Schedules array
	    special case this one?
* Finish Schedule Edit:
  * Directed By, Actors
  * Current Recordings
* Split Previous Recordings into Previous & Current for Edit Schedule
  * Previous can then call Control/ClearPreviouslyRecordedHistory/{scheduleId}
* show "no entries" in various tables when there's nothing to display:
  * search results
* EPG: if viewing in past, and no programmes are shown, go to Now automatically
* finish Remove All in View Previously Recorded History


Advanced Stuff to consider:
* when doing a search, don't use LoadingSpinner to block the entire app, just show a searching row
  * how do we decide which operations pop up LoadingSpinner?
	* anything that causes app-wide notifications I guess?
  * user can go to EPG or whatever
  * when search is done, show a tab bar badge


* figure out when a page should refresh
  on initial load, in LoadingTVC, get enough to render initial pages, like Schedules
  don't pull in new info when a view appears (iPad now inline with iPhone for viewDidLoad)
  reload any list that we think has changed, pretty much already doing this
  like when a schedule changes/deleted
  leave manual refresh there for fixing up if they edit on another device


NEW IN 0.24
* crash in Edit Schedule 'On Days' fixed
* rare crash on switching to EPG Grid fixed
* experimental threading of some API requests to improve UI responsiveness
* internal cleanups, as always :)
